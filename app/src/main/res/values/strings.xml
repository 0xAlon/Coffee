    <string name="text2">It’s just a moment in time \n just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand. But it’s a connection. \n\n We make sure everything we do honours that connection from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly. \n\nFrom our beginnings as a single store nearly forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been and every place that we touch, we\'ve tried to make it a little better than we found it.</string>
    <string name="text1">It happens millions of times every week \n a customer receives a drink from a Starbucks barista \n but each interaction is unique.</string>
